        <p><strong>Advertising Process.</strong></p>
        <p>This article describes our advertising process works. After carefully reading through this page, you should have a good idea on how
          advertising takes place in the app and how to effectively promote your product and services to users in the app. The process is pretty straight forward and easy once you understand everything.
        </p>
        <p>This article is divided into 3: <a href="#uya">Uploading your advert</a>, <a href="#pd">pricing details</a>, <a href="#mya">Monitoring your Advert</a> and Reimbursing your Advert.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h1 id="uya"><strong>Uploading your Advert.</strong></h1>
        <p>To advertise here, you will first be required to upload your advert. I will describe the whole process and explain exactly what everything does when uploading your ad. First you will need to navigate to the Dashboard.
          Once there scroll down until you see a card marked "Share your product with the world! Advertise". Click on it.</p>
        <img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">

        <p>Once you do so you should be navigated to a page looking like this:</p>
        <img src="images/select_category_advertiser.png" alt="selectCategory" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>Here you will be required to select the category your product or service falls under. Each group of similar categories falls under a general category set, eg. farming land, fertilizer products, farming equipment, animal foods, agriculture stores etc. all fall under agriculture.</p>
        <p>You can scroll down to browse through the category sets, and scroll left-right to scroll though the categories in each set. So if you wish to advertise your restaurant, for instance, you would pick 'restaurants' under food.</p>
        <img src="images/scroll_select_cat_gif.gif" alt="scrollSelectCategory" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">

        <p>Once you find your suitable category, click on it. You should see a pop up dialog that looks like this:</p>
        <img src="images/select_cpv_advertiser.png" alt="selectCPVAdvertiser" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>Here you will be required to select the category of users you are targeting. The app gives users freedom to choose the amount they charge for each advert they see. It then group the users who charge similar amounts together for advertisers to select.</p>
        <p>We recommend users to charge 3Ksh, and we recommend you to target users who charge 3Ksh since it is a fair price for you and the users. The amount you choose will determine the amount you will pay to advertise.</p>
        <p>Below the checkboxes, there are texts that indicate the number of users who charge the various amounts; like in this case, 3 users (who have subscribed to restaurants) charge 3Ksh.</p>
        <p>Note that the values shown may change from time to time since the app gives users freedom to change the amount they charge and also the categories they've subscribed to.</p>
        <p>Finally, click continue once you've selected your preferred user category</p>

        <br>
        <p>You should be redirected to a page looking like this:</p>
        <img src="images/adupload.png" alt="adupload" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>Once here, you will first need to select your advert's banner image. When selecting the image, be sure to use one that fits the aspect ratio required so as to bring out the best quality of the banner. Also make sure to use a good quality image with an adequate resolution.</p>
        <p>To select an image, click on the button marked 'Select image' or on the place-holder image in the card. You should be redirected to your gallery folder where your images are stored like so:</p>
        <img src="images/select_image_gif.gif" alt="selectImageGif" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>When you select an image, the image will be set in the card. This will give you an idea of how your advert will look once it is being showcased to users.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Next you will need to select the number of users you wish to target. The app allows you to pick a certain number(in 100 user denominations) of users you want to see your ad. This is to allow you(and other advertisers) to be able to target users based on your financial
          ability. So, small businesses and start-ups can afford to advertise to a small audience while larger corporations and international businesses can reach a large audience since they typically have a larger marketing budget.</p>

        <p>To do so, click on the button marked 'Number of People' to set the number of users: </p>
        <img src="images/select_number_button.png" alt="selectNumberButton" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>After doing so, you should see a prompt dialog box with a scroll wheel. The scroll well is used to select the number of users:</p>
        <img src="images/select_number_of_users.png" alt="selectNumberDialog" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">
        <p>The numbers shown on the scroll wheel are by 100(*100 users), eg. in the example image, its 1*100 which is 100 users. Note that the app has a set minimum of 100 targeted users and you cannot set a number less than that.</p>
        <p>Once set, the number of users chosen will be shown next to the button and a upload button will be visible.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Once set, you can upload your ad. But before you do so, there are a few other options you can set. First is a website link. If you are advertinsing a service or product, you can add your website for users to be able to visit.</p>
        <img src="images/add_link_button.png" alt="addLinkButton" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 70px;">

        <p>Next, filtering users. The app allows you to perform further targeting based on criteria such as age, sex/gender and user locations. By doing this, you are essentially filtering your audience based on the selected preferences. Therefore, if a given user does not meet your set
          criteria, they will not engage your ad.</p>
        <video id="video" width="25%" height="25%" controls>
          <source src="images/filter_users_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>Remember, while selecting the age group, the two scroll wheels represent the starting and ending ages. So in the example, users from 23 to 26 years will see the ad.</p>
        <p>Also, while selecting locations in the maps, users within a 1000 meter radius(1Km radius) will engage the ad. The radius is represented by the light pale green circle around the marker. To add a marker, simply click on the map. To remove a marker, simply click on the marker.
          to move a marker, simply press and hold on a marker until it is unpined from the map then move it to the prefered location.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Finally, you may upload your ad. To do so, click on the button labelled 'Upload'. As of now, we only support MPesa payments. You will receive a bottom prompt requesting for your phone number and email. Then after confiming all the details, a prompt will appear like so:</p>
        <img src="images/pay_via_mpesa.png" alt="payViaMpesa" width="25%" height="25%" style = "padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <p>You should be redirected to your sim tool-kit app requesting for your Mpesa password. Once you put the password, the payment will be completed. The app will automatically detect the payments once complete and will proceed to upload your advert.</p>

        <br>
        <h1 id="pd"><strong>Pricing Details.</strong></h1>
        <p>For the purpose of simplicity, pricing details will be described for every one user targeted.</p>
        <p>Users in the app charge for their time: 1Ksh, 3Ksh and 6Ksh. Therefore, the cost of advertising here depends on the amount charged by each user targeted. We charge 2Ksh on top of the amount charged by the user targeted. So for instance, if a user charges 3Ksh the total price
          would be 5Ksh.
        </p>
        <p>
           For user payouts, Mpesa charges 15ksh(between 0.01Ksh and 99.99Ksh) to make a transfer to the users Mpesa acount for every payout they make. Unfortunately, this is a cost you may have to incur as well. So if a user charges 3ksh, you may have to pay 20Ksh(3Ksh + 2Ksh + 15Ksh). However, the payout
          cost is not a cost you may incur alone.
        </p>
        <p>Different advertisers may target the same user in a given day and as a result, the user may engage in multiple advetisements before making a payout. Therefore, the cost for making the payout will be divided among the advertisers who targeted the user and the total remaining amount
          paid will be divided amongst the advertisers and will be added to their reimbursements.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, if a user(charging 3Ksh) sees 4 adverts in a given day between making payouts, they will only need 15Ksh to make payouts. But since each of the 4 advertisers paid 15Ksh, a total of 60Ksh, 45Ksh is not needed. Therefore, the app will divide the 45Ksh between the 4 advertisers and add to their reimbursement
          totals. So in reality, each advertiser only pays 3.75Ksh for the users payout instead of 15Ksh. We refer to this as cost splitting.</p>
        <p>Please note that the pricing may change in the future.</p>
