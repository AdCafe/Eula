        </br>

        <p><strong>Advertisement process.</strong></p>
        <p>To advertise here you will first be required to select the category of product you are advertising. For instance, if you are advertising a womens fasion store, you may select the category "womens clothing stores" as this will allow you to reach
            users who are only interested in womens fasion stores, clothing and such. After selecting a category, you will be required to choose a category of viewers based on the amount each user charges for evey banner they see. All users have been
            grouped based on the amount they charge for their time and selecting a group will determine the amount you will pay to advertise. After that you will then be required to select an image which will be the banner of your advertisement.
            The image banner will act as the advert and is what the final viewer of your advert will see. After that you will be required to select the number of users you wish to target. You will select in 100 (One Hundred) user denominations; therefore
            you cannot select less than 100 (One Huundred) users as it is the minimum amount you can choose to target.
            Afterwards you will be required to provide us information that we will use to make payment requests (See -<a href="privacy.html#payouts">Privacy Policy</a> ).
        </p>
        <p>When selecting the image, be sure to use one that fits the aspect ratio required so as to bring out the best quality of the banner. Also make sure to use a good quality image with an adequate resolution. Poor resolution images will not be accepted
          well by your targeted audience. You also have an option to add a website link. You can paste a link to any relevant website in relation to the
          product or service you are advertisind. For instance, if you are advertising an online clothing store, you can add a link to its website.
        </p>
        <p>Also be sure to monitor your advert statistics (such as users reached and amount to be reimbursed) and in the event your advert does not reach the targeted number you chose, be sure to checkout the
          remaining amount. This is to ensure that you only pay for the number of users you reach.
        </p>
